Pleasant 10 min walk along the sea front to the Water Bus. restaurants etc. Hotel was comfortable breakfast was good - quite a variety. Room aircon didn't work very well. Take mosquito repelant!,1
Really lovely hotel. Stayed on the very top floor and were surprised by a Jacuzzi bath we didn't know we were getting! Staff were friendly and helpful and the included breakfast was great! Great location and great value for money. Didn't want to leave!,1
"We stayed here for four nights in October. The hotel staff were welcoming, friendly and helpful. Assisted in booking tickets for the opera. The rooms were clean and comfortable- good shower, light and airy rooms with windows you could open wide. Beds were comfortable. Plenty of choice for breakfast.Spa at hotel nearby which we used while we were there.",1

"We loved staying on the island of Lido! You need to take a water is from Venice to get there. From the train station, a boat ride takes 45 minutes but has beautiful views along the way. Hotel is an EASY walk from the boat dock. The room was very clean and the breakfast was plentiful. We would definitely recommend this hotel!",1
Lovely view out onto the lagoon. Excellent view. Staff were welcoming and helpful.,1
The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable. My wife and I had a room with a terrace over looking the water...it was a great view! I will look to stay at this hotel my next time in Venice...very pleased.,1
"Nice hotel , with very friendly staff and helpful - great choice for breakfast , something for everyone.",1
DON'T stay here unless you're less than 2 feet tall or like sleeping with centipedes. We asked for a broom to get rid of the centipede. Later in the day the receptionist said she gave us something to control the bugs. We never complained about the drain flies so she must have noticed a problem. ,0
"We had absolutely no problems whatsoever with this hotel and were very pleasantly surprised by the quality considering the low price. The dcor of the room was pleasant and flawless, unlike many of the Venice hotels I've stayed in. The breakfast buffet was delicious too. And to finish all this off, the staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. In terms of location, the hotel is about 10 minutes walk from the Lido waterbus stop, then a boat takes around 15 mins to get into Venice. We didn't find this a problem at all - we knew this was going to be the case so had pre-booked transport tickets to save money. The surrounding Lido is pleasant and worth an explore in a spare couple of hours. In conclusion, I would book this again due to the fantastic quality of the hotel, despite the trade-off of not being in Venice itself.",1
"Lovely hotel, 10 min walk to the water bus stop on lido. Away from the madness of Venice, but close enough to be there in less than 20 minutes.",1
"Located on the Lido I would recommend this hotel if you require a little piece and quiet after the busy day's in Venice, facility's good, staff very friendly and very helpful. I requested flowers for the room as it was one of my wife's special birthday's, and yes they ordered exactly as requested, can't ask for more. Rooms are a little on the small side but in line with most European hotels of this standard so wasn't a surprise or a problem, room and bathroom was cleaned every day with fresh towels supplied each day. Buffet breakfast had various options to suit most peoples taste but It was a surprise to see sausage, bacon and scrambled eggs available, must have been put on to satisfy us Brits! We stayed during late September so the Lido is probably quieter at that time however we felt very safe walking around late at night back to the hotel but taxis are available if you feel a little vulnerable. Restaurants and coffee bars are located in the main commercial area close to the Waterbus stations and tend to be slightly cheaper than in Venice. We had a water taxi (think luxury speed boat!) from the airport to the hotel and back again, quite an experience, a little costly but well worth it, a lot quicker and less hassle than the Waterbus. Venice was very busy during the day time, St Marks Square at night is a must, fantastic atmosphere. All in all we had a great time in Venice, it can be a little expensive so don't ponder over the bills to much, just pay up with a smile!",1
Great stay...close to ferry.food not so good nearby,1
"Stayed with parents, wife twin toddlers in two triple rooms. The hotel is easy to reach and the rooms were well placed well furnished. The best feature was extremely friendly helpful staff, particularly Ms. Annalucia Ms. Anna who were always ready to listen help out with big smiles. The breakfasts were very good, with good spread and the guests were made welcome to sit and eat at leisure (more important when you are with toddlers!) Would surely go back to Venice would happily stay again at Russo Palace.",1
This hotel is in Lido which is a better choice than staying in crowded Venice. The water bus is very convenient and it takes only few more stops to the main attractions in Venice. We received excellent service - many thanks to Anna and Donnatella who made us feel at home.,1
"It was a 10 min+ walk to water bus, would have liked it closer. Located on the water on Lido island, away from the rush of Venice",1
Room was tiny-bed saggy-bAthroom door didn't work. Good breakfast and convenient location. Wouldn't return or recommend.,0
"VERY FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL WITH DIRECTIONS, KNOWING ALL THE RIGHT PLACES TO VISIT AND WHERE TO EAT TH BEST FOOD IN THE AREA. The Front Desk Receptionists were extremely helpful ..especially Sabrina who made us feel very welcomed to Lido....We will be back next year for sure!",1
"Really enjoyed the stay, about a 10min walk to the main waterbus station. Had the perfect quiet location and staff were really friendly!!",1
Friendly reception very helpful. Hotel has pleasant views and is about ten minute walk to main water bus terminal to take you any direction. We used the spa one day. Good saunas but relaxation area noisy and small. Some lovely restaurants close by and cheaper than in Venice.,1
"Great hotel, staff where amazing and the location and views make this a great Base to visit Venice!",1
"Close to Venice and decent hotel, breakfast was okay with no too much selection but has everything you need.",1
"beautiful views of Venice in the lovely relaxed calmer area of Lido Di Venezia. Gorgeous sunsets and very easy to access Venice, rather than satying in the hustle and bustle. Close to only beaches in Venice. Staff were so helpful, especially Ivan and the lady we met on the desk each morning.",1
This is a great little hotel. We had a wonderful view from the room and patio. Good size. Breakfast was great even had North American breakfast foods. Only issue was the two twin beds pushed together. That was very uncomfortable.,1
"Nice staff. Nice location. We booked two nights at Russo hotel on Lido strip and two nights in the very center of Venice. This is a good balance. Lido is a bit further but it feels more local and is more relaxing too, it gave us a taste of Dolce Vita. We didn't see it on the hotel description but they offered us a taxi boat ride to Murano with another couple for free. The boat ride was very pleasant, they dropped us in a glass blowing factory shop, the glass making demonstration was nice and there was very little pressure to buy. Internet was free for 20 minutes/day but a bit slow like everywhere in Venice. So in short a good pick, good value for money.",1
Nice and clean. Rooms are spacious with air conditioning. Good selection of breakfast. Within easy reach of San Marco. Quite location.,1
"We had a wonderful, relaxing time. The staff were completely attentive and accommodating. We had a corner king room with a kitchen, two patios and a deluxe bathroom. You had to drive into town but they said that Uber is available if you need it. This was our first visit to Palm Springs and hopefully not our last! It really... More",1
"We were in Palm Springs on the day the temperature was 123 degrees! Despite that, we had a wonderful stay because of the Little Paradise hotel. The staff were friendly and accommodating, and all of the little complimentary touches were so nice, like a bottle of wine for us in the fridge, sun care products near the pool, and a... More",1
We arrived in Palm Springs not sure what to expect....it's a quiet kinda place in 'low season'....we drove down what appeared to be a residential street...parked up at a wooden gate and weren't sure what to expect. What awaited took us back in amazement...the room is spacious with an air of decadence...the welcome wine and comprehensive breakfast was more than... More,1
"This place really is a little paradise!! A beautiful boutique style hotel with EVERYTHING meticulously thought out to make our vacation perfect. Saltwater pool, fresh fruit, BEST showerhead I've ever experienced, I can go on and on. The bed was so comfortable and we slept like babies. Victor did a wonderful job and Judy was just lovely and personable!",1
Spent 3 nights at Little Paradise boutique hotel on a mother-daughter trip. Wonderful and relaxing experience. Clean and newly redone rooms that are well equipped and spacious. Perfect location off the main street in a quiet neighborhood that is close to downtown Palm Springs. The pool area has a nice gas fire pit area and lots of comfy chaise lounges... More,1
"This little hotel surpassed all my expectations. The rooms are well equiped with a little kitchenette, fridge was filled with croissants, 3 bottles of water, soda and much more. The room was very clean and the bathroom was equiped with a top notch shower. I would definately recommend this place to anyone visiting or passing trough Palm Springs. The reception... More",1
"If you want peaceful and relaxing look no further. Although set up like a single floor motel it is hardly anything but. The rooms are very nice with a full kitchen. They provide some breakfast items, snacks and bottles of spring water. You can bring in anything you like to enjoy at the pool or in your room. By the... More",1
All the reviews are great and agree on this fine little place. I'd also like to add the wonderful service you will find here with Victor and staff who seem to want to do anything and everything to make you happy. The king beds here are just amazing. We seldom run into beds this comfy. The room has a large... More,1
We went for a relaxing weekend as an offshoot of a family visit. This was a great place to go with a nice room and a view of the mountains from just outside. The ONLY thing we didn't like was that the sun dropped below the mountains too early and the temperature dropped along with it. Maybe you can fix... More,1
"We were on a business trip to Anaheim and, afterwards, drove to Palm Springs for a relaxing weekend. It turned out that this hotel was the perfect place! We arrived late and were pleasantly surprised upon checking in to see that, not only were the accommodations incredibly thoughtful and comfortable, but the refrigerator came stocked with croissants, bagels, cream cheese,... More",1
"Victor and Judy were truly accommodating hosts, especially when we had to cut our stay short due to illness. Everything that has been written by other reviewers was spot on. It is more like a small inn or bed breakfast (with the breakfast left in the fridge in your room) than a hotel. There are eight guest rooms around... More",1
"If you want to relax, want a quiet atmosphere, cozy setting.. this is the place. It is definitely a smaller, boutique-type hotel and it feels that way. So that's good for some and maybe not as much for others. The room is great, very pretty. Very impressive large, new Curved HD TV. So that's nice! The small kitchen is also... More",1
"Stayed 5 nights and it was delightful. Lovely comfortable,well lit, great shower and bathroom,kitchen with microwave,fridge etc and very functional room. Ten hotels on this trip but this one seems to have thought of everything. Peaceful yet near the main streets with lovely shopping, art and some great restaurants. Good local transport but downtown is walkable but a bit over... More",1
"New everything would be great from the moment we came through the gate. Nine excellent, high quality rooms each with a small kitchen/diner and terrific shower room including twin wash basins. Each room faces onto the pool with plenty of sun loungers, towels, shaded areas and comfortable seating. Rooms furnished to extremely high standard and beds have the finest linen... More",1
"Spend four days there and would have prolonged our stay if they only had a room available. Welcoming host, all rooms around the patio / pool. This place breathes tranquility and relaxation. Since you normally travel by car in this country anyways, everything is close by.",1
"I'm going to keep this fairly short but what I will say is if you are going to stay in Palm Springs please stay here. It's not right on the main drag but it's in a lovely residential area, no noise, ample parking and just so peaceful. Only 5 in an Uber to the main strip with the bars and... More",1
"We had unit 4 on the east side of the complex for 3 nights - very quiet, very comfortable bed, nice amenities in room - killer shower!! pool was large, heated, wonderful - Judy hope I got that right made us fresh orange and banana smoothies when we were in the pool - breakfast in fridge was just ok, little... More",1
"Stayed 3 nights in this beautiful hotel. This place is very clean, rooms have all been recently upgraded. Big comfortable bed, nice kitchen with granite countertops, fridge, Keurig coffee maker, and even a two burner stove. Bathrooms are big with granite countertops, two sinks, and a huge shower. Pool area is gorgeous and the owner and staff make you feel... More",1
"This place is just perfect for everyone looking for some rest in lovely and warm Palm Springs. The host welcomed us very very friendly, explaining us what we could find where. The private kitchen had our breakfast and a complimentary bottle of wine. The room (call it the appartment) had everything and was very well decorated and had an outside... More",1
"Little Paradise is called a hotel, but it is more of a motel tucked away in a nice neighborhood district with similar styled single story boutique motels/hotels. This is not your large chain full service hotel but a nice hideaway with just a few rooms surrounding a warm salt water swimming pool. There is no on-site restaurant but you get... More",1
"If you are being treated at any Texas Medical Center facility this is a good place to stay. Very clean, decent breakfast, and shuttle. The only negative is that the shuttle doesn't run in the middle of the day making it inconvenient to return to the hotel following an appointment. We have had to take a taxi a few times.... More",1
This Comfort Suites was a terrific hotel. The staff was friendly and the room was clean and a good size. There was great food for breakfast and a large variety. It was very convenient for our trip. We went to an Astros game and the drive was about 18 minutes. We went to the Johnson Space Center the next day... More,1
"Great location walking distance to NRG Stadium. Next door to Pappa BBQ (warning- good, but very smoky flavor). Hotel was nicely decorated, gave a warm welcome. Front desk staff was friendly, though distracted. Our room, while quite large (we had an accessible room), had two ACs that did not de-humidify the room. It felt damp/humid the whole stay. Though... More",1
"The room was clean, the hotel workers were very good and the breakfast was also good. But the kennel with the dogs was awful. These dogs starting barking at six in the morning. The television in my room was a twenty inch LG. I will never go back there again.",1
"Only .3 (three tenths!) of a mile away from the Kirby St. gate of NRG Stadium. It can even be considered walking distance, and you avoid the price of parking! How nice it is to be so nearby after attending an exciting event at NRG Stadium.....saving the possibly long drive home, or to the airport, for the next day.",1
"On our two trips prior to this one both the breakfast and the internet were below par. I am glad to report that on our most recent trip the internet worked great and the breakfast was much improved. When you go to Texas for cancer treatment, the little things become big things. You can stay here with confidence.",1
Stayed here for two nights to visit MDA. The rooms are clean. The bed is comfortable. The internet worked great. The staff was nice. Close to many restaurants. I highly recommend. We stayed at Best Western the last visit and had a total different (bad) experience.,1
"I was a bit concerned after checking the rating of this hotel, but was so pleasantly surprised when I got there. I was basically there for a medical visit and it seemed like so were a lot of other people, but we would totally stay there if we were just visiting Houston. My mom checked in for me since I... More",1
"We stay here each time my husband has a medical appt in Houston and they do offer medical rates if you ask. It is near medical center off of Main St. Very quiet and very clean large rooms. Several eating places within walking distance. Offers medical center shuttle also. The pool is very small, but we don't use that anyways... More",1
Visited the comfort suites in new iberia louisiana and my daughters head was almost decapitated in the elivator. When i talked to the front desk to make a complaint and get the front desk to give me the corporate information she gave me a cell phone number instead of the corporate office . We called numerous times before an answer... More,1
"I have been staying here, off and on, four about 7 years. The first time was when my father was going thru treatment at MD Anderson. The staff were great, made accommodations for him and also for his caregivers. They were also very understanding for those going thru treatments also local hospitals. I have also stayed there during my pre... More",1
"Very nice, like new lobby and rooms. Lobby and halls have tile floors that look great. Fancy, large chandelier in lobby. Hotel is 13 years old but looked like it was remodeled recently. Near Rice University. Had a security guard on duty. Fridge in our room was noisy. Dual phone charger ports by bed and on desk. Lots of digital... More",1
"The hotel was great, staff was great only bad thing was the breakfast as I am a choice hotel guy and most of the comfort suites have a great breakfast this one kinda lacked. But Staff and rest of the hotel was great",1
We stayed here because of a family medical emergency.Did not have any options for a room. We had the SMALL queen room--think it may have been laundry area previously. Bed fair. Room quite. Was OK for one night. This hotel is near the stadium. Price was ok .99 plus tax.,1
"The room was fine and the mattress was very comfortable. Unfortunately, I arrived while the front entrance was under-construction. There was not sufficient signage to find out how to enter the building. I would have left, had I not already had a reservation through Hotels.com.",1
 I am so angry that i made this post available via all possible sites i use when planing my trips so no one will make the mistake of booking this place I made my booking via booking com We stayed for 6 nights in this hotel from 11 to 17 July Upon arrival we were placed in a small room on the 2nd floor of the hotel It turned out that this was not the room we booked I had specially reserved the 2 level duplex room so that we would have a big windows and high ceilings The room itself was ok if you don t mind the broken window that can not be closed hello rain and a mini fridge that contained some sort of a bio weapon at least i guessed so by the smell of it I intimately asked to change the room and after explaining 2 times that i booked a duplex btw it costs the same as a simple double but got way more volume due to the high ceiling was offered a room but only the next day SO i had to check out the next day before 11 o clock in order to get the room i waned to Not the best way to begin your holiday So we had to wait till 13 00 in order to check in my new room what a wonderful waist of my time The room 023 i got was just as i wanted to peaceful internal garden view big window We were tired from waiting the room so we placed our belongings and rushed to the city In the evening it turned out that there was a constant noise in the room i guess it was made by vibrating vent tubes or something it was constant and annoying as hell AND it did not stop even at 2 am making it hard to fall asleep for me and my wife I have an audio recording that i can not attach here but if you want i can send it via e mail The next day the technician came but was not able to determine the cause of the disturbing sound so i was offered to change the room once again the hotel was fully booked and they had only 1 room left the one that was smaller but seems newer ,0
 My room was dirty and I was afraid to walk barefoot on the floor which looked as if it was not cleaned in weeks White furniture which looked nice in pictures was dirty too and the door looked like it was attacked by an angry dog My shower drain was clogged and the staff did not respond to my request to clean it On a day with heavy rainfall a pretty common occurrence in Amsterdam the roof in my room was leaking luckily not on the bed you could also see signs of earlier water damage I also saw insects running on the floor Overall the second floor of the property looked dirty and badly kept On top of all of this a repairman who came to fix something in a room next door at midnight was very noisy as were many of the guests I understand the challenges of running a hotel in an old building but this negligence is inconsistent with prices demanded by the hotel On the last night after I complained about water damage the night shift manager offered to move me to a different room but that offer came pretty late around midnight when I was already in bed and ready to sleep ,0
 Backyard of the hotel is total mess shouldn t happen in hotel with 4 stars ,0
 Cleaner did not change our sheet and duvet everyday but just made bed They also didn t clean the floor and changed the body gel when we run out of it ,0
 Even though the pictures show very clean rooms the actual room was quit dirty and outlived Also check in is at 15 o clock but our room was not ready at that time,0
 The aircondition makes so much noise and its hard to sleep at night ,0
 Very steep steps in room up to the bed not safe for children I asked to move rooms and was put in another identical one Room decoration was minamilist which I like but felt prison cell sparse,0
 We did not like the fact that breakfast was not included although you could pay extra for this The room we stayed in was lacking in space a bit and the bathroom was very badly lit to use the mirror in there which meant getting ready for evening a bit tricky but only a small negative comment ,0
 We had issues with our electronic key everyday It deactivated It wasn t kept near our phones but somehow there was an issue The staircase for our bed was steep and no handrail The tea coffee facilities weren t updated daily And the floor was dusty and had hair on it and that was upon our arrival That situation didn t change Other than those minor issues the hotel was lovely ,0
 Bed was on upper level with a narrow twist staircase No USB port for mobile phone charging not even via thr tv s Some sockets didn t work and had loose covers dangerous Some corridors were poorly lit ,0
 Our room was an overrated disaster room 231 dirty smelly hot and very noisy of the banging doors in the corridor and from the other rooms We moved the couch a bid and the dirt and dust of months no cleaning appeared the smell of the gutter was very disturbing the lighting was too weak and a black bathroom is the worst design disaster one can imagine We found the whole hotel dirty dusty and dated To spend more then 243 Euros for a dirty attic room is daylight robbery ,0
 Sadly I cannot say that the rooms are clean enough for me When we got in our room we immediately notice there s something wet and sticky like juice or something just next to our bed We called the front desk and they said they will send a cleaning lady to us We waited at least half an hour and no one showed up We had to go to the front desk and complain again When we got back later in the evening the juice has been removed but there s still some hair on the spot We were however no interest to complain anymore Also on the wall in the room on the curtain and in the bathroom there s a lot of stains which I had to ignore the whole time I didn t feel comfortable at all The staff at front desk are very friendly However I guess they pay really bad to their cleaning ladies First you will not be greeted by the cleaning staffs if you run into one at the hallway What more annoying is that I got woke up at 7 in the morning by the cleaning ladies because they closed the doors so loudly when they were cleaning other rooms And they didn t close it loudly just once but for at least on hour They kept open and close the door I was really annoyed I was in my holiday and I just wanted to have a good sleep at least The parking place was small but ok When we arrived the ticket machine was broken Someone told us we don t need a ticket to get in for now and we just have to inform the front desk when we check in We did so and paid for 2 days when we checked out When we drove out the ticket machine was broken again So we didn t actually have to plug in the ticket which we have paid with a lot of money Of course we should pay for it because we parked there but still I was not so happy because I have the feeling that I paid for nothing ,0
 Transportation was a bit of a pain but on route to your destination there is amazing views at every corner ,0
 The bathroom in our room was a black glass box It theory it s cool in practice it leaves a lot to be desired Little privacy not enough light at the mirror and the shower leaked into the hall It did however allow for a loft space with a desk chairs and a second tv ,0
 Nothing at all to do with the Hotel of course but people tend to Slam their bedroom doors as they leave so if you re thinking of having a little lay in just be prepared for a Slam to awake you Other than that nothing to fault at all ,0
 Careful they are still renovating the building and start at 8am so it suits for business people but if you want a relaxing stay the noise can annoy you ,0
 We had 2 different rooms here and both were duplexes with identical floorplans There was very little space and the staircase was precarious with no handrail Was kind of a pain to have to go downstairs every time we needed something out of our luggage or needed to use the bathroom ,0
 There is an ongoing construction enlarging the hotel The hotel s restaurant is nice but overpriced The bathroom is not very practical ,0
 Little bit on the pricey side,0
 Extensive restorations works going on We had scaffolding outside our window blocking the view Temporary reception area The building is an old hospital you can still see the hospital aspects on the inside When the work is completed i m sure it will be fabulous No fridge in the room well there was one but it was very ineffective ,0
 Our bathroom had an urine order Shower was very slippery No shower chair handles or bars Bed was uncomfortable and mattress pad was too big and you felt like you were falling off Very expensive and breakfast was not included Construction and remodeling were going on and we were inconvenienced by it There was a park and that was nice Not close to town or museums ,0
 Very nice hotel manager he upgraded us because we had troubles with two different rooms They do everything to make you feel welcome and comfortable The park directly in front of the hotel is amazing rent a bike directly and make a tour Also the bathtub and bed is great ,1
 Bathroom lighting could have been brighter The airconditioning of our room 303 could not be turned down lower than 23 degrees celcius The refrigerator in our room was not cooling there was no thermostat The toiletries were not replenished shampoo shower gel dispenser was empty and was not replenished on the second day either ,0
 The hotel is under construction which was never mentioned when I booked it or at any point until we arrived there We then wandered around empty half finished corridors looking for the temporary lobby The room was nice but the bathroom is a glass box inside the bedroom it s not in anyway private Showering or using the toilet feels aptly like you are performing in some kinky Amsterdam window there was also a nail sticking up at the entrance of the glass bathroom which I first discovered with my barefoot We woke up to the sound of scaffolding being hammered together and someone drilling concrete Hardly the relaxing break from noisey London that I believed I had booked The pictures are of a hotel looking over a park yet the room looked over an empty courtyard scattered with random bits of scaffolding and debris The first floor corridor smelled like they were having some serious blocked plumbing issue or perhaps another guest was very unwell Their 17 breakfast is really lazily thrown together with cheap products and entirely tasteless honestly not worth it get breakfast somewhere else instead We spent 100 in 3 days on uber because this hotel is over a mile from anything and the novelty of walking around pretty canals ends 20 minutes before this hotel even comes into view They will also take 50 deposit from you in advance for every day you are planning to stay This meant on arrival I suddenly had to pay a further 150 which caused a non sterling transaction charge on my card only to have the full amount refunded when we left minus the bank charges for this pointless but menditory transaction We made the best of it but I really wish they had been open about the current state of the place and I definitely would have stayed somewhere else ,0
 The hotel is a little out of the main town but accessible by tram The hotel restaurant was a little disappointing the food was great but we waited too long for it due to waiting staff prioritising large groups ,0
 Service horrible Pillows super stiff and big could break your neck Room service was done they removed the towels and did not leave us with anything Door was not closing and found out on second day that it can be easily opened Service in general was poor I would not stay here,0
 When arriving I was told I had to pay 19 city tax That wasn t shown on the policies I pre paid extra for there to be petals on the bed there were no petals The sheets weren t changed the cleaner just made the bed didn t even sweep the floor When checking out the receptionist said she would call a taxi for us We waited 30 minutes after 15 we asked how long it would be she said I will check she said that twice Made us late for the airport and nearly missed our flight Wasn t happy at all ,0
 when you take a shower the whole floor is in the water problem with opening the garage door curtained window some construction,0
 there was construction work going on in the hotel which i was not expecting and would like to have known about in advance the bar staff we not keen to serve use when we arrived late from the airport at 11 30pm despite at check in being told the bar was open until 12 mid night ,0
 Some building work was being carried out during our stay which was noisy but obviously unavoidable stairs in our room were very narrow and steep which meant getting up in the middle of the night to go to the toilet was a real task ,0
 Soundproofing was poor could hear everything from outside our room and woke one morning thinking someone had come into our room as sound was so clear Service and food in the restaurant was awful at dinner so we didn t eat there again ,0
 Very bad attitude of personnel at Breakfast Only allowed one coffee from the Coffee machine filter coffee was free Rude behavior of the manager Room was noisy because of dripping water sound heater system in room ,0
 The bath tub wasn t completely clean that would be my only gripe ,0
 Not being told a hedkandi night was across from our room leaving us with no sleep Room could have been allocated to someone attending the night instead of us Just bad organisation on room allocation ,0
 Asked for more coffee and sugars only got given two satchets of each Room cleaned floor not hovered as the rug was very messy Wifi worked for half a morning then never connected again for the whole trip ,0
 Room was not cleaned correctly Wine Champagne glasses left dirty in the room the floors felt dirty and the shower drain was clogged From the day we arrived ,0
 The bathroom was amazing Though we were two friends sharing and it had a glass screen so it was a bit uncomfortable at times They should think about a screen or opaque glass ,0
 Our room didn t have a sofa in but these two uncomfortable chairs and the stairs was too steep for the room Didn t feel safe going up and down the stairs but these are minor issues I would recommend the hotel to anyone ,0
 The hotel is being renovated Which means that you will literally be drilled out of your bed starting at 7am We paid EUR350 for a large room but really it was not worth the money ,0
 I can t think of anything that we didn t enjoy ,0
 The cleaniness of the rooms can be better Check refrigerator regulary and the rooms can use a good cleaning scrub Also the floor was really sandy and there was an odor in the hallway and room Some extra pillows to watch tv would be nice too Restaurant some nice varpet at the fire place would spice it up And cookies with your tea coffee hot choco it s a star hotel ,0
 Wasn t told about renovations going on staff in the restaurant very slow ask to order got told table service then when they did come over were told the restaurant had closed The man covering the night shift wasn t very helpful ,0
 The hotel is currently being renovated Being an old building you hear a lot of noise of people walking by your room or in the rooms above Mini Bar empty No remote for the TV Heating direct above the bed and quite noisy ,0
 Initial room was small but we were quickly swapped into a bettet room without fuss,0
 That I wasn t told about the refurbishment so when we arrived i had told my girlfriend after a long tiring day it was a beautiful hotel which when we got there was covered in building works We had to walk through a temporary wood tunnel had no milk in our room for refreshments When walking around there was nobody very empty feel ,0
 Maintenance work on facade of hotel no advance warning and some rather inadequate drinks token to make up for it Leaking air con above bed was noisy and was dripping Stained carpet Not very safe feeling a steep staircase to the sleeping area with no barrier from 2 3m high Not much useful information No minibar Understaffed reception long wait ,0
 No ground floor room as requested 2 months ago first room totally freezing etc restaurant under par Much better last time we stayed Prices gone up ,0
 We booked 3 twins and were given 2 and a double which they couldn t change Not happy Plus bathroom had a horrible smell coming from the drain ,0
 Even allowing for the hotel being under major renovation works the quality of service leaves a lot to be desired Noise of running water coming from the heating system disturbed our sleep considerably No remediation possible Toiletries in bathroom had been used by previous guests Some were empty some partially used Checkout at 12 30 1hour after official checkout time was declined as priority is given to a tour group arriving earlier than normal checkin time Having paid over 300 for 1 night stay this is somewhat disappointing Service at breakfast was very poor Shabby state of hotel with the exception of the rooms is perhaps explained by the renovation works and work still to be done ,0
 The room was tall narrow and small with an integral bathroon Having a shower steamed up the room and soaked the floor as the glass shower panels did not have any doors to stop water going everywhere ,0
 In a terrible state with builders everywhere We had to wait to get into our room as the conference event builders were blocking the door Our room that we were told was new was in a poor state of repair ,0
 So lets start from the weird thing that happened in one of the rooms we were staying One person in our group got 220v electric chock which went through her hands It came from water boiler or lamp due to either a bad wireing faulty socket lamp or water boiler Luckily the rooms fuse discharged and cut the electricity in the room immediately The hotel covered doctor expences were very sorry about what had happened and send a fruit basket to a room They also let us have a late check out for free of charge Thats all of the compensation we had In my opinion the compensation was not that big for endangering a life of guest or what do you think The managemt had a chance to read and comment my review before i posted it The hotel management answered that this electric problem is now fixed but its still unclear if they checked other renovated rooms for faulty wireing too It anyway seems that the management does not worry about this that much since the management said that they did nor endanger any lives in the hotel Ofcource the managent was also very sorry in the answer about what had happened Some information gaps there seemed to be between the manager and the personnel since the cleaner came to ask us when are we leaving and the keys stopped working before the time we had been granted to leave Picture is from bathroom lamp that had nothing to do with the insident but such wireing was visible in the rooms,0
 There were Construction Works and such information was not passed to us when we booked There was dust everywhere and the shower was blocked the bathroom flooded everytime we took a shower Too dark common reas ,0
 The work being done externally right now is off putting on arrival Will look great once finished but we did get free drinks to compensate ,0
No Negative,0
 Our room was a little compact probably due to it being a loft room at the end of the building However the design tried to maximise its quirky layout ,0
 Got charged 50 for a birthday package when it was advertised for 30 on the website This was apparently due to city taxes which we were unaware of The shower was blocked and would flood the room after one use We were unable to get rid of the water so couldn t use the room after we d had a shower Couldn t check us into our room at 3pm had to wait extra 30 minutes Standard Breakfast was very expensive at 17 I highly suggest not to buy Cigarette machine was broken and staff still allowed us to try and use Overall a disappointing stay for a birthday weekend ,0
 split level bedrooms although quirky are impractical 1 TV remote for both tv s but on differernt floors A C is located downstairs so very impractical to have to go downstairs to adjust The walls are also very thin not good sound proofing ,0
 Building work starting at 7am waking us up no mention of building work on booking com and on hotels web page it does say renovations but not that there would be noise disturbance Also air conditioning very very loud,0
 Hotel is having some construction work done this I can live with the tables and general cleanliness of the restaurant was not 4 star all the surfaces were sticky and full of old food the room had a very narrow and steep staircase to get to the bed really difficult to come down I thought,0
 There was a girl working in the restaurant and we asked her a few things about the dessert but she didn t know alot The staff that evening didn t walk by our table once and when they did they didn t take our plates The staff the next day though was more experienced and very outgoing So our dinner of the night before was immediately forgotten and we had a great night at your restaurant ,0
 it s a shame about all the construction going on because it looked like such a beautiful place but we couldn t see a lot ,0
 Building work is being done but it doesn t case any hassle ,0
 Construction during the day though not intrusive,0
 The front desk staff particularly the young men tended to be a bit spaced out and were not very helpful at times however the female attendants on the desk were quite efficient and knowledgeable Breakfast was a bit pricey especially for two people combined ,0
 No Limited A C in common areas Dangerous metal ornaments on all banisters Musty smell throughout common areas Deluxe rooms very small impractical design Impractical shower design no place for soap Poor quality bed mattress Room refrigerator barely worked Food in restaurant overprices only fair quality Overall dark rundown dreary appearance,0
 There was a loud noise outside my room on the first night like a generator Perhaps it had to do with the renewal works in place ,0
 The hotel is under reconstruction although it didn t affect us Overall it s a lovely hotel very spacious ,0
 there is a renovation ongoing in front of the hotel which will hopefully be completed soon as it kills the view,0
 Staff promised things they didn t deliver Room was very small bathroom cramped location generally distant ,0
 We would have liked to know in advance that the hotel is being renovated We had a room right in front of the building site and were waken up at 6 30 because of the noise Booking com should warn travellers for this so they can ask for a room on the quiet side of the hotel ,0
 I wouldnt be able to recommend my grandparents as there are stairs in our room i also dont remember reading that there are stairs in the room although its fine for us as we are only 20 ,0
 The outside of the hotel is under construction It will look beautiful when it s done ,0
 the room next to us were quite loud at night time which proved it a bit difficult to sleep on times The bathroom was really damp due to the wet room and water went by the toilet so we had to wear shoes when using the bathroom after showering The staff member who checked us in charged us a 150 security fee and we were told that this would not be deducted from our bank only held but it was which resulted into the bank blocking my card due to an unauthorised foreign payment Check this when checking in and make sure the bank is aware ,0
 The hotel gardens and patios were under major renovation The sidewalk entrance was a mess There was no mention of this at all on the booking com website We were given a voucher for one drink cocktails excluded as compensation Not good enough ,0
 Major construction work underway next door as part of hotel expansion Room on 2 levels with very steep staircase which made going to the toilet in the night a very dangerous experience After complaining they did agree to move us to room on one level Food in restaurant leaves a lot to be desired for anyone wishing to have food anything except medium rare Despite friendly staff will not be returning cannot recommend ,0
 The first room had steep steps to a loft bed Not practical and dangerous for someone 68 especially if he has to go to the bathroom in the night Second night had a room on one level ,0
 The bathroom has cristal walls and it is not comfortable at all The room size was also pretty small ,0
 Our suite on the 3 floor was beautiful but our mattress probably old was slumping in the middle The staff could not provide a board to put under to make it better and at the time there was no other suite available though smaller rooms were offered For the price you would have expected at least a comfortable bed,0
 The shower was useless and when it worked it soaked the entire bathroom meaning we had to use all our towels to dry the floor was a disaster The room wasn t cleaned properly in a long time just cleaning round the edges The bed room was up a slight set of stairs which left it very warm because we were along way form the window which left the room stuffy and over heated having to go up and down stairs that were dangerous to the toilet or to get a drink was a nightmare The stairs are dangerous and narrow wouldn t be suitable for older people or kids You definitely get what you pay for It was half clean and not very central,0
 Overpriced breakfast Bed too soft Bath had no shelf to leave bottles etc on Building works impact on overall good impression ,0
 We were upgraded which was lovely but the heating didn t work and the room was cleaned once in 3 days We had to ask for more towels We ordered two burgers which were disgusting and the meat smelled bad after 3 mouthfuls my friend was sick ,0
 We did have what looked like blood splashes all up the top of our curtains Told reception but nothing was done about it It definitely didn t put us of our stay and wouldn t stop us going back ,0
 The bathrooms only had smoked glass walls which did not provide as much privacy as we are used to The lighting in the halls was too dim ,0
 We had one of our items we bought taken possibly mistaken as rubbish even though this wasn t in the bin no where near the bin and next to other gifts we bought We told reception but nothing came of it Very disappointing as this made us feel our other belonging where not safe in the hotel from there on ,0
 Two storey room with narrow winding stairs Wet room d cor and functionality Lack of storage space,0
