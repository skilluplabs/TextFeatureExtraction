Pleasant 10 min walk along the sea front to the Water Bus. restaurants etc. Hotel was comfortable breakfast was good - quite a variety. Room aircon didn't work very well. Take mosquito repelant!,
Really lovely hotel. Stayed on the very top floor and were surprised by a Jacuzzi bath we didn't know we were getting! Staff were friendly and helpful and the included breakfast was great! Great location and great value for money. Didn't want to leave!,
Ett mycket bra hotell. Det som drog ner betyget var att vi fick ett rum under taksarna dr det endast var full sthjd i 80 av rummets yta.,
"We stayed here for four nights in October. The hotel staff were welcoming, friendly and helpful. Assisted in booking tickets for the opera. The rooms were clean and comfortable- good shower, light and airy rooms with windows you could open wide. Beds were comfortable. Plenty of choice for breakfast.Spa at hotel nearby which we used while we were there.",

"We loved staying on the island of Lido! You need to take a water is from Venice to get there. From the train station, a boat ride takes 45 minutes but has beautiful views along the way. Hotel is an EASY walk from the boat dock. The room was very clean and the breakfast was plentiful. We would definitely recommend this hotel!",
Lovely view out onto the lagoon. Excellent view. Staff were welcoming and helpful.,
ottimo soggiorno e ottima sistemazione nei giorni frenetici di inaugurazione della Biennale. Le signore alla reception sono efficientissime e squisite e non sono da meno le ragazze che servono la prima colazione. Da tornarci,
"Gnstiger Ausgangspunkt fr Venedig Besuche. Ruhige Lage auf dem Lido. Flugplatz Lido und Bootsanlegestellen fulufig erreichbar. Zimmer ziemlich eng, aber alles vorhanden. Frhstck fr Italien ausgesprochen reichhaltig. Hotel sollte regelmig einen Kammerjger beschftigen, da ein Befall mit Wanzen festzustellen war.",
"Lidoen er perfekt til et par dages ro og afslapning, skn strand, lkkert omrde og lille hyggeligt familiehotel med et sdt personale",
"Accueil chaleureux, en franais Changement du linge de lit tous les jours, lit confortable, salle de bain de bonne taille et bien quipe. Petit djeuner copieux et vari.",
It was ok hotel is nice from in and out but room was small we paid for double bed bat they atteched 2 single bed,
"Klasse Frhstck, freundliches und aufmerksames Personal, gute Anbindung nach Venedig, Zimmer vllig ok und sauber, Parkplatz in der Nhe gut verfgbar. Wrden wir wieder whlen!",
"Bardzo sympatyczna obsuga, klimat hotelu. wietna azienka, widok na zatok. Bardzo dobry stosunek cena/jakosc. Polecam!",
Bra o lugnt lge. Stor terrass. Nra till den hrliga Lidostranden.Bara en TV-kanal. Bra frukost. Litet opraktiskt badrum.Trevlig och kunnig personal.,
The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable. My wife and I had a room with a terrace over looking the water...it was a great view! I will look to stay at this hotel my next time in Venice...very pleased.,
"Nice hotel , with very friendly staff and helpful - great choice for breakfast , something for everyone.",
"Wir hatten leider Pech mit unserem Zimmer,war in einem winzigen Hof, sehr hellhrig. Personal war sehr nett, Frhstck sehr gut.",

"Hotellihuone oli ullakolla, jossa ei pystynyt kvelemn suorassa. Huonekorkeus oli suurimmassa osassa n. 1,5m. Huoneestamme varastettiin rannekoru ja neuletakki. Lisksi Spa ei ollut hotellissa vaan n. kilometrin pss toisessa hotellissa. Laivalaiturilta oli kilometrin matka hotelliin. Lidon saari on kyll hyv majoituspaikka kun vierailee Venetsiassa, mutta en suosittele tt hotellia.",
"DON'T stay here unless you're less than 2 feet tall or like sleeping with centipedes. Our 4th floor room was an attic with a vaulted ceiling that angles down to 3ft. The bed is only accessible from one side. If you placed your head in the skylight on the other side you might able sit up. The bathtub was impractical with broken shower head. We moved to the 1st floor the next day and within minutes found a centipede on the wall and15 flies. We asked for a broom to get rid of the centipede. Later in the day the receptionist said she gave us something to control the bugs. We never complained about the drain flies so she must have noticed a problem. That night we spent 2 hrs catching 6 centipedes in our room. 2 came from throw pillows. We asked reception for a new room or hotel but there supposedly weren't any hotels with open rooms and if we wanted leave we would have to pay for transportation and both hotels. The next morning we went to reception to tell them about the bug problem. We barely said anything before the woman apologized and said they didn't put the bugs in the room on purpose so we should just go about our day and forget it. She added that she often goes on vacation with her children and sometimes things happen, so she tries to make the best of everything and not start a war. Adding, a few euros isn't going to make anything go away so we should just go enjoy the day because more we talk the less time we have.",
"We had absolutely no problems whatsoever with this hotel and were very pleasantly surprised by the quality considering the low price. The dcor of the room was pleasant and flawless, unlike many of the Venice hotels I've stayed in. The breakfast buffet was delicious too. And to finish all this off, the staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. In terms of location, the hotel is about 10 minutes walk from the Lido waterbus stop, then a boat takes around 15 mins to get into Venice. We didn't find this a problem at all - we knew this was going to be the case so had pre-booked transport tickets to save money. The surrounding Lido is pleasant and worth an explore in a spare couple of hours. In conclusion, I would book this again due to the fantastic quality of the hotel, despite the trade-off of not being in Venice itself.",
"Wir buchten das Hotel fr 4 Nchte in der Woche vor Ostern. Der Aufenthalt war durchweg angenehm. Das Frhstcksbuffet war reichhaltig und frisch (allerdings rate ich von dem Rhrei ab). Wenn etwas aufgebraucht war, wurde es umgehend aufgefllt. Vom Frhstcksraum aus konnte man den Blick ber die Lagune genieen. Obwohl unser Zimmer im Erdgeschoss zur Nebenstrae hin lag, war es dort sehr ruhig. Die Einrichtung ist geschmackvoll und zweckmig. An Sauberkeit mangelte es nicht. Obwohl wir nicht den Anspruch stellten, wurden die Handtcher tglich gewechselt. Das einzige Manko war die Temperatur des Duschwassers. Es wechselte stndig von ziemlich kalt zu sehr hei. Erwhnenswert ist auch das Waschbecken. Der Wasserhahn ist ziemlich klein und so ber dem hervorstehenden berlauf angebracht, dass es schon schwierig ist, die Hnde darunter zu waschen. Der Empfang an der Rezeption war sehr freundlich. Leider war unser Koffer nicht mit uns angekommen. Die nette Empfangsdame kmmerte sich darum und hielt Kontakt mit dem Flughafen. Am nchsten Tag wurden wir vom Hotel aus benachrichtigt, dass unser Koffer nun da sei. Gleich in der Nhe des Hotels ist eine Bushaltestelle. Wir fuhren allerdings nie mit dem Bus, da der Weg zum Anleger fr die Wasserbusse nicht weit war. Das Warten auf den nchsten Bus htte mitunter lnger gedauert, als zu Fu zu dem Anleger zu gehen.",
"Lovely hotel, 10 min walk to the water bus stop on lido. Away from the madness of Venice, but close enough to be there in less than 20 minutes.",
"Das Hotel liegt auf der Insel Lido neben Venedig, direkt am Meer mit Blick auf Venedig. Lido kann man sehr gut mit den Booten erreichen. Vom Bootsanlegeplatz sind es ca. 400 m zum Hotel an der Kste entlang. Den Weg mussten wir zu Fu zurcklegen, da keine Busse wegen einer Baustelle dorthin fahren. Wir wurden sehr freundlich empfangen, berhaupt war das Personal im Hotel sehr nett und hilfsbereit. Das Zimmer war gemtlich eingerichtet, das Bad relativ gro und alles sehr sauber und ordentlich. Auch mit dem Frhstcksbffet waren wir sehr zufrieden - gute Qualitt und relativ groe Auswahl. Wir waren rundherum zufrieden und wrden das Hotel sofort wieder buchen.",
"Located on the Lido I would recommend this hotel if you require a little piece and quiet after the busy day's in Venice, facility's good, staff very friendly and very helpful. I requested flowers for the room as it was one of my wife's special birthday's, and yes they ordered exactly as requested, can't ask for more. Rooms are a little on the small side but in line with most European hotels of this standard so wasn't a surprise or a problem, room and bathroom was cleaned every day with fresh towels supplied each day. Buffet breakfast had various options to suit most peoples taste but It was a surprise to see sausage, bacon and scrambled eggs available, must have been put on to satisfy us Brits! We stayed during late September so the Lido is probably quieter at that time however we felt very safe walking around late at night back to the hotel but taxis are available if you feel a little vulnerable. Restaurants and coffee bars are located in the main commercial area close to the Waterbus stations and tend to be slightly cheaper than in Venice. We had a water taxi (think luxury speed boat!) from the airport to the hotel and back again, quite an experience, a little costly but well worth it, a lot quicker and less hassle than the Waterbus. Venice was very busy during the day time, St Marks Square at night is a must, fantastic atmosphere. All in all we had a great time in Venice, it can be a little expensive so don't ponder over the bills to much, just pay up with a smile!",
"Mysigt med fina rum, bra frukost och nra bde till stranden och btterminalen.",
"Hotel ist sehr gut , wir waren zum zweiten mal in diesem Hotel. Das Personal ist sehr freundlich. Einzig was zu bemengeln ist Fernsehen kann man nur zwei Programe, aber das ist im Urlaub nicht so wichtig.",
Wir hatten ein Zimmer mit Balkon und Blick auf die Lagune - wunderschn!!!,
Great stay...close to ferry.food not so good nearby,
"Stayed with parents, wife twin toddlers in two triple rooms. The hotel is easy to reach and the rooms were well placed well furnished. The best feature was extremely friendly helpful staff, particularly Ms. Annalucia Ms. Anna who were always ready to listen help out with big smiles. The breakfasts were very good, with good spread and the guests were made welcome to sit and eat at leisure (more important when you are with toddlers!) Would surely go back to Venice would happily stay again at Russo Palace.",
Nous avons pass 4 jours dans cet htel situ 5 mn pieds des des vaporetto. Le personnel est trs sympa parle franais. Toujours l pour donner de bons conseils sur les restaurants ou les visites. Rien redire. Tout tait bien. Chambres petit djeuner et environnement.,
This hotel is in Lido which is a better choice than staying in crowded Venice. The water bus is very convenient and it takes only few more stops to the main attractions in Venice. We received excellent service - many thanks to Anna and Donnatella who made us feel at home.,
"It was a 10 min+ walk to water bus, would have liked it closer. Located on the water on Lido island, away from the rush of Venice",
Room was tiny-bed saggy-bAthroom door didn't work. Good breakfast and convenient location. Wouldn't return or recommend.,
"Htel trs bien situ dans un coin calme loin de l'agitation frntique du centre de Venise, mais seulement quelques minutes de bateau. Les chambres conomiques sous toit ne sont pas trs ergonomiques cause de la pente de toit et il fait vite chaud s'il y a du soleil lorsque l'air conditionn ne fonctionne pas encore, comme lors des congs de Pques. La vue extrieure se limite aux velux. La TV n'est pas un cran plat. On s'attend un peu plus de luxe dans un 4 toiles, mais les prix sont contenus. L'accueil est irrprochable et le petit djeuner est trs correct.",
"VERY FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL WITH DIRECTIONS, KNOWING ALL THE RIGHT PLACES TO VISIT AND WHERE TO EAT TH BEST FOOD IN THE AREA. The Front Desk Receptionists were extremely helpful ..especially Sabrina who made us feel very welcomed to Lido....We will be back next year for sure!",
No shower but jets in the bathtub and my room was slanted but made it work,
"Hotel sympathique et silencieux sur l ile du Lido a quelques minutes en vaporetto de Venise. Personnels trs avenants et parlants plusieurs langues, dont le franais. Voyage dpaysant et inoubliable... aucune voiture l horyzon",
"Havde 7 overnatninger i april 2015 p Hotel Russo Palace p Lidoen i Venedig. Personalet var alle ualmindeligt hjlpsomme, sde og imdekommende. Vi fik mange gode tips til restauranter og sevrdigheder. God og hjertelig stemning. Rolig beliggenhed. Morgenmaden var god med meget at vlge imellem.",

"Really enjoyed the stay, about a 10min walk to the main waterbus station. Had the perfect quiet location and staff were really friendly!!",
Nyrenovert bad hevet opplevelsen.,
Prima uitval basis voor stedentrip. Rustige buurt,
"Walls extremely thin, you can hear everything. Excessive hoovering every morning outside bedroom. There. Is a bar, but no one to tend it.",
"If you're looking for a hotel where the action is, go elsewhere. The hotel is on the Lido, which is about a 10-15 minute waterbus ride away from Venice. However, if you're looking for a place on the Lido, this is a well-priced option. The staff was great with handling/recommending dinner reservations, even during an insane Carnevale weekend. The doors are a little thin and since the building is old, the soundproofing needs improvement. The quarters are cramped, but the room comes with breakfast. If we wanted to stay on the Lido again, this would be a good option, but next time I think we'll opt for a place closer to the action. Recommended.",
"Hotel facilities are good and breakfast ample. Econmy rooms have sloping roof so tall guests mind your head We stayed in one and it was fine, the occational bump but for the price you cant really complain.",
Friendly reception very helpful. Hotel has pleasant views and is about ten minute walk to main water bus terminal to take you any direction. We used the spa one day. Good saunas but relaxation area noisy and small. Some lovely restaurants close by and cheaper than in Venice.,
It was a bit far from city center,

"Close to Venice and decent hotel, breakfast was okay with no too much selection but has everything you need.",1
"beautiful views of Venice in the lovely relaxed calmer area of Lido Di Venezia. Gorgeous sunsets and very easy to access Venice, rather than satying in the hustle and bustle. Close to only beaches in Venice. Staff were so helpful, especially Ivan and the lady we met on the desk each morning.",1
This is a great little hotel. We had a wonderful view from the room and patio. Good size. Breakfast was great even had North American breakfast foods. Only issue was the two twin beds pushed together. That was very uncomfortable.,1
"Nice staff. Nice location. We booked two nights at Russo hotel on Lido strip and two nights in the very center of Venice. This is a good balance. Lido is a bit further but it feels more local and is more relaxing too, it gave us a taste of Dolce Vita. We didn't see it on the hotel description but they offered us a taxi boat ride to Murano with another couple for free. The boat ride was very pleasant, they dropped us in a glass blowing factory shop, the glass making demonstration was nice and there was very little pressure to buy. Internet was free for 20 minutes/day but a bit slow like everywhere in Venice. So in short a good pick, good value for money.",1
"Wir waren das erste mal in Venedig und wrden jederzeit wieder dieses auf Lido gelegene Hotel buchen. Freundlicher Service, direkt am Kanal mit tollem Blick und entspanntes Parken.",
Nice and clean. Rooms are spacious with air conditioning. Good selection of breakfast. Within easy reach of San Marco. Quite location.,1

Spent 3 nights at Little Paradise boutique hotel on a mother-daughter trip. Wonderful and relaxing experience. Clean and newly redone rooms that are well equipped and spacious.

We went for a relaxing weekend as an offshoot of a family visit. This was a great place to go with a nice room and a view of the mountains from just outside.
